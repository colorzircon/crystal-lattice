# crystal-lattice
This project is for use as a visual aid for materials science students. It essentially depicts five basic crystalline structures on the atomic scale.

The MME folder contains the files for the web page. I have also included the Sketchup model, as well as some of the Ruby scripting I used to help me generate the geometry.


The interactive demo can be found at http://david82.ucoz.com/

Right now, you select the type of lattice, and whether it is cross-sectioned along the close-packed plane, with the dropdown menu.
The first three sliders designate the opacity of the atoms, with 'Solvent' being the main atom, and the other two being interstitial atoms. 
The fourth and fifth sliders control the position of the camera, as if on a gimbal, and the sixth slider dollys in and out.

Here is a video explaining the project: https://youtu.be/iZbiheCQpLE
